# 0.4.0

* Support for downloading reports from locations other than montagu.  This includes a breaking change, where ther `server` argument to `pull_dependencies` and `pull_report` changes to `from` to `remote`.  The structure here will probably change a little further in a future version.

# 0.3.4

* Support for creating "shiny apps" as artefacts
