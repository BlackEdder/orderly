Suppose you have a sequence of reports that you always want to run together. This might be a set of reports which you always want to run at the same time e.g. when new data comes in. Or a set of dependent reports where you want to ensure whenever one of the reports in the stack is changed the whole set of reports are re-run to create an up to date final output. Orderly workflows can help to make it easier to define and run these sets of reports together.

### Configure workflows

Workflows are defined through a yaml file in a `workflows` directory as `<workflow_name>.yml`

``` {r comment = NA, echo = FALSE}
dir_tree(path)
```

The workflow yaml contains a list of steps of reports to be run in order.
``` {r results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
yaml_output(readLines(file.path(path, "workflows", "my_workflow.yml")))
```

At the moment workflows can only be run with default parameters for each report.

### Running a workflow

To run a workflow use `orderly::orderly_workflow`

``` {r}
out <- orderly::orderly_workflow("my_workflow", root = path)
```

This returns a list of the IDs of each of the reports run as part of the workflow
```{r}
out
```

`orderly_workflow` needs to know the root of the orderly reports directory to be used. You specify this explicitly via the `root` arg or use your working directory. If your working directory is somewhere within the reports repository then you can run `orderly::orderly_workflow("workflow_name", locate = TRUE)` which will search for the root directory from your current working directory. See `?orderly::orderly_workflow` for more details.

### Running with remote

Like `orderly::orderly_run` `orderly::orderly_workflow` supports running with a remote db source or resolving dependencies from a remote machine. These can be used via the `instance` and `remote` args in the same way as `orderly::orderly_run`.
