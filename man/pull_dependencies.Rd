\description{
Download dependent reports from Montagu.  This requires the
montagu package and for montagu's credentials to be correctly set
up.  The \code{pull_archive} function pulls report directly
(without it being a dependent report).
}
\details{
To use this functionality you will need to have \code{montagu}
installed, and be part of the VIMC team.  To set it up run

\preformatted{
options(montagu.username = "your.email@imperial.ac.uk")
}

You can add that line to your \code{~/.Rprofile} file perhaps -
see \code{path.expand("~/.Rprofile")} for where this file lives on
your computer.  After setting your username up you can run
\code{pull_dependencies("reportname")} to pull the
\emph{dependencies} of \code{"reportname"} down so that
\code{"reportname"} can be run, or you can run
\code{pull_archive("reportname")} to pull a copy of
\code{"reportname"} that has been run on the production server.
}
