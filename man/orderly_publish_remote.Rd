\title{Publish orderly report on remote server}
\usage{
orderly_publish_remote(name, id, value = TRUE, config = NULL,
  locate = TRUE, remote = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of the report (unlike
\code{\link{orderly_publish}} this must be provided sorry)}

\item{id}{The report id}

\item{value}{As \code{\link{orderly_publish}}, \code{TRUE} or
\code{FALSE} to publish or unpublish a report (respectively)}

\item{config}{An orderly configuration, or the path to one (or
\code{NULL} to locate one if \code{locate} is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{locate}{Logical, indicating if the configuration should be
searched for.  If \code{TRUE} and \code{config} is not given,
then orderly looks in the working directory and up through its
parents until it finds an \code{orderly_config.yml} file.}

\item{remote}{Description of the location.  Typically this is a
character string indicating a remote specified in the
\code{remotes} block of your \code{orderly_config.yml}.  It is
also possible to pass in a directly created remote object (e.g.,
using \code{\link{orderly_remote_path}}, or one provided by
another package).  If left \code{NULL}, then the default remote
for this orderly repository is used - by default that is the
first listed remote.}
