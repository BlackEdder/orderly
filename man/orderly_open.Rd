\usage{
orderly_open(id, name = NULL, path = NULL, locate = TRUE,
  draft = NULL)

orderly_open_latest(name = NULL, path = NULL, locate = TRUE,
  draft = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{The identifier of the report - can be \code{latest}, in
which case \code{name} and \code{draft} must be specified}

\item{name}{The name of the report.  Can be omitted if \code{id}
is not \code{latest}}

\item{path}{The path to an orderly root directoy, or \code{NULL}
(the default) to search for one from the current working
directory if \code{locate} is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{locate}{Logical, indicating if the configuration should be
searched for.  If \code{TRUE} and \code{config} is not given,
then orderly looks in the working directory and up through its
parents until it finds an \code{orderly_config.yml} file.}

\item{draft}{Logical, indicating if a draft report should be
found.  Practically only useful when \code{id = "latest"} but
might be useful to ensure presence of a particular type of
report.}
