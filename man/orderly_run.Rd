\usage{
orderly_run(name, parameters = NULL, envir = NULL, config = NULL,
  locate = TRUE, echo = TRUE, id_file = NULL, fetch = FALSE,
  ref = NULL, open = FALSE, message = NULL,
  extended_output = FALSE)

orderly_data(name, parameters = NULL, envir = list(), config = NULL,
  locate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of the report to run (see
\code{\link{orderly_list}}).}

\item{parameters}{Parameters passed to the report. A named list of
parameters declared in the orderly.yml.}

\item{envir}{The parent of environment to evalute the report in;
by default a new environment will be made with the global
environment as the parent.  For \code{orderly_data}, this may be
\code{list()} in which case a list will be returned (rather than
an environment).}

\item{config}{An orderly configuration, or the path to one (or
\code{NULL} to locate one if \code{locate} is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{locate}{Logical, indicating if the configuration should be
searched for.  If \code{TRUE} and \code{config} is not given,
then orderly looks in the working directory and up through its
parents until it finds an \code{orderly_config.yml} file.}

\item{echo}{Print the result of running the R code to the console}

\item{id_file}{Write the identifier into a file}

\item{fetch}{Logical, indicating if git should be fetched before
checking out the reference \code{ref}.}

\item{ref}{A git reference to use for this run (see Details)}

\item{open}{Open the directory after running?}

\item{message}{An optional character string containing a message
explaining why the report was run}

\item{extended_output}{Return detailed output about the run
(similar to the contents of \code{orderly_run.rds}).}
}
\description{
Run a report.  The \code{orderly_data} function is for testing the
queries (and developing the report).
}
\details{
If \code{ref} is provided then before running a report orderly
will try to check out (as a detached \code{HEAD}) \code{ref},
interpreted as a git reference.  This can be a commit, tag, or a
branch name (including remote).  The working directory must be
clean according to \code{git status} and this \emph{will} require
some careful use of \code{.gitignore} to exclude \code{draft},
\code{archive}, \code{data} and \code{orderly.sqlite}.  The git
tree will revert back to the original branch at completion (or
failure to complete) the report.
