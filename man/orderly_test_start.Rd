\usage{
orderly_test_start(name, parameters = NULL, envir = .GlobalEnv,
  config = NULL, locate = TRUE)

orderly_test_end(cleanup = FALSE)

orderly_test_restart(cleanup = TRUE)

orderly_test_check()
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of the report to run (see
\code{\link{orderly_list}}).}

\item{parameters}{Parameters passed to the report. A named list of
parameters declared in the orderly.yml.}

\item{envir}{The parent of environment to evaluate the report in;
by default a new environment will be made with the global
environment as the parent.}

\item{config}{An orderly configuration, or the path to one (or
\code{NULL} to locate one if \code{locate} is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{locate}{Logical, indicating if the configuration should be
searched for.  If \code{TRUE} and \code{config} is not given,
then orderly looks in the working directory and up through its
parents until it finds an \code{orderly_config.yml} file.}

\item{cleanup}{Delete testing directory on exit?  If \code{FALSE}
then you will probably want to use \code{\link{orderly_cleanup}}
later to delete the test directory.  Note that it is not
possible to commit the results of an orderly test run}
}
\description{
For interactive testing of orderly code.  This runs through and
sets everything up as orderly would (creates a new working
directory and changes into it, pulls data from the database,
copies over any dependent reports) but then rather than running
the report hands back to the user.  The prompt \emph{looks} like
\code{\link{browser}} but it is just a plain old R prompt and the
code runs in the global environment.
}
\details{
To quit run \code{orderly_test_end()} (or enter \code{Q}, like
\code{browser}).  To test if all artefacts have been created run
\code{orderly_test_check()}.
}
