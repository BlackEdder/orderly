## Use case

A research group with a potentially changing SQL database who want to create reports (knitr documents, csv exports, graphics) from the database but who want to be able to trace back from a report to metadata about what created it.

## The process

* (optional) Establish temporary SQL views in the database
* Run one or more queries against the database and extract a set of data
* Run an R script against the exported tables, producing one or more report artefacts
* Save a set of metadata
* Archive the exported data set

## Workflow

1. **Prototyping**: use `data_db` to create a connection to the database and write queries ad hoc
2. **Fine tuning analysis**: Use a wrapper (what one?) to pull data from the database
3. **Automated**: use the full wrapper
