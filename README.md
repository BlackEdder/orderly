> 2. a soldier who carries orders or performs minor tasks for an officer.

## Use case

A research group with a potentially changing SQL database who want to create reports (knitr documents, csv exports, graphics) from the database but who want to be able to trace back from a report to metadata about what created it.

## The process

* (optional) Establish temporary SQL views in the database
* Run one or more queries against the database and extract a set of data
* Run an R script against the exported tables, producing one or more report artefacts
* Save a set of metadata
* Archive the exported data set

## Database schema

`orderly` has a database, which should be the preferred way of querying `orderly` from other programs.  The schema is programmatically described at [`inst/database/schema.yml`](inst/database/schema.yml) and automatically generated database documentation is available [here](https://vimc.github.io/orderly/schema).

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("drat")
drat:::add("vimc")
install.packages("orderly")
```
